# File for specifying custom stopping point offsets for symbolic point.
# Each line can contain single offset configuration for a symbolic point.
# One symbolic point can be multiple configurations. E.g. for different resource types. First matching offset configuration is used.
#
# Format: Symbolic Point ID:Resource barcode or tool ID:Resource Type ID:Apply Rule:Transversal offset:Longitudal offset:Heading offset:Machine IDs(optional)
# Resource barcode or tool id: data provided by MES interface or AGV about the load that is taken onboard or that is onboard AGV. This offset is used only if such barcode or tool id is detected or if value is 0 or empty.
# Resource Type ID: If value > 0, this offset is applied only if related resource is of this type. 0 to ignore resource type.
# Apply rule: Bit masked rules: bit0: apply when picking resource, bit1: apply when dropping resource, bit2: apply when just stopping (no actuator control at target). E.g. value 2 would result this offset to be used only when AGV is coming to drop off resource.
# Transversal offset: In meters, positive value to the left of the route. 0 = no offset
# Longitudal offset: In meters, positive value to drive past symbolic point position. 0 = no offset
# Heading offset: In degrees. Positive value counter-clockwise from the routes frame heading. 0 = no offset
# Machine IDs: AGV IDs separated with comma. If defined, the offset configuration is valid only for listed AGVs
#
# Example: 100::3:1:0.03:0.1:-1.5:1,2,4
# Means: Offset is for Sympoint 100, only for resource type 3, when coming to pick up the resource.  
#        The AGV would stop 3 cm to the left of the route that AGV uses to arrive, and overhoots 10 cm. The frame heading would be rotated 1.5 degrees clockwise.
#        The offset would be applied to AGVs 1, 2 and 4
