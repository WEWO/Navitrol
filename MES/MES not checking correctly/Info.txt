Order 207.

AGV send to IC205 (and IC206) but after one check got stuck in wrong check, or performed wrong check.
System does not continue now. AGV is not asked to check and will not send any check info to MES.

Situation2 is the first issue after a good series is no issues
Both agvs were active although agv 1 was almost done with the order
