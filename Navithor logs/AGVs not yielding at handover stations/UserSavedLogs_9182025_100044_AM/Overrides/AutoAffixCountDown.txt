# File for automatic affix countdown to trigger different resource type and a pickup request.
# Each line should contain 6 to 9 items (7-9 are optional) separated with : 
# Countdown is active when a specific resource type is at location and location is enabled.
# 
# Example line:
# TargetSymPointID:ResourceTypeID_countDown:ResourceTypeID_ResultType:AffixAtStart:AffixMax:AffixDropRate:DisableLocRule:enableLocIDs:InitWithRes
# 
# DisableLocRule: 0 = do not disable, 1 = disable loc when ResourceTypeID_countDown is received, 2 = disable loc also initially
# enableLocIDs: These locations will be enabled, when the resource transforms into ResourceTypeID_ResultType.
# Multiple symbolic point IDs can be defined by separating them with ,
# InitWithRes: 1 = initialize location with ResourceTypeID_countDown, 0 = don't change existing status.
